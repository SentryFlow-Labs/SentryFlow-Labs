> **"The Firewall for Autonomous Agents."**

## 🚨 The Problem
AI Agents (AutoGPT, BabyAGI) are vulnerable to **"Dependency Injection"**.
If your `requirements.txt` is not sanitized, malicious actors can inject "Poisoned Packages" that steal your API keys.

## 🔒 The Solution: SentryFlow
SentryFlow is a headless security engine that:
1.  **Scans** your dependency tree for known threats.
2.  **Locks** unpinned versions.
3.  **Issues** a "Verified Clean" Certificate for your users.

## ⚡ How to Use
This is a **Premium Security Tool**.
You can run the scanner, but the **Clean Certificate** is locked behind a license key.

### Installation
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/SentryFlow-Labs/SentryFlow-Labs](https://github.com/SentryFlow-Labs/SentryFlow-Labs)
cd SentryFlow-Labs
